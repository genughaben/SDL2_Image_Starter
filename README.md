# SDL2 / SDL2_image / SDL2_ttf Starter

Contains a minimal SDL2 / SDL2_image / SDL2_tff starter (d'oh!), to kick of you next C++ Gaming Project.

## Prerequisites

Installation of SDL2 / SDL2_image / SDL2_ttf is required.

### MacOS (because that is where I am)

Either: You can do that by downloading the Development Version for each, 
saving that to /Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework and /Library/Frameworks/SDL_image.framework.

Or: You can use brew to have it installed for you.

```bash
brew install SDL2 SDL2_image SDL2_ttf
```

### IDE

You can choose whatever you want, but if definitely works with IntellJ Clion. And therefor IntellJ IDEA with plugins, I suppose.
But I think nothings speaks agains Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or XCode or whatever else.


### Tips: 

Kinda obvious, but you may want to rename the folder an project form SDL2_Image_Starter to something more meaningful. 
Search for "SDL2_Image_Starter" and replace it with something more meaningful.
